This project is a Daily Task Tracker (To-Do-App) built using Vite + React for the frontend and JSON Server for the backend to store data locally.

Set up the backend by installing JSON Server using npm i json-server and start it with npx json-server db.json . To run the React app, use npm run dev. Once everything is running, you can add, edit, and delete and complete task.
